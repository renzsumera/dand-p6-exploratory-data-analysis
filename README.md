# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Overview
Used R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques of the quality of white wine. Relationships in one variable to multiple variables were explored along with distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Dataset
The tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

## Submission
1. The RMD file containing the analysis (final plots and summary, and reflection)
2. The HTML file knitted from the RMD file using the knitr package
